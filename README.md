## 🎥 Demo Video

> **Note**: A full gameplay demonstration will be linked here soon.

[![Shapes War Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)](https://github.com/amr10w/ShapesWar-SFML/blob/main/assets/78f27128-e9cc-45be-879a-2d1fe6cc0efe)

## ✨ Features

- **Custom ECS Engine**: Modular design using a custom Entity-Component System for high performance.
- **Dynamic Enemy System**: Randomly generated enemies with varying polygon shapes (3-8 sides) and randomized velocities.
- **Config-Driven Gameplay**: All balance parameters (speed, size, colors, spawn rates) are loaded from an external text file.
- **Special Weaponry**: High-score reward mechanics that unlock powerful radial blast attacks.
- **Smooth Collision Logic**: Circle-based bounding volumes for accurate hit detection between all game entities.
---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++17
- **Graphics & Input**: SFML 2.6.1 (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Build System**: CMake 3.14+
- **Compiler**: MinGW-w64 (GCC)

## 📦 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed to build the project from source:

| Requirement | Purpose | Download Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Git** | Version Control | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| **CMake** | Build Management | [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/) |
| **MinGW-w64** | C++ Compiler | [winlibs.com](https://winlibs.com/) |
| **VS Code** | Development IDE | [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) |

> **Note**: SFML is automatically downloaded and configured by CMake using `FetchContent`, so you don't need to install it manually.

### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify each tool is accessible from the command line:

```bash
git --version
cmake --version
g++ --version
mingw32-make --version
```

---

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amr10w/ShapesWar-SFML.git
cd ShapesWar-SFML
```

### 2. Configure the Project with CMake

Create a build directory and configure the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
```

> **Important**: The `-G "MinGW Makefiles"` flag tells CMake to generate Makefiles compatible with MinGW.

### 3. Build the Project

Compile the source code:

```bash
mingw32-make
```

Alternatively, if you're using **Visual Studio Code**, you can use the built-in CMake tools:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` → Type `CMake: Configure`
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + B` to build
- Or press `F7` to build with default tasks

### 4. Run the Game

After building, run the executable from the terminal:

```bash
.\build\ShapeWar.exe
```

Or in **Visual Studio Code**:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + F5` to run without debugging
- Press `F5` to run with debugging

## 🎯 Gameplay Mechanics

### Enemy System

- **Randomized Spawning**: Enemies spawn at random intervals with varying polygon shapes (3-8 sides)
- **Speed Variation**: Each enemy has randomized speed within configured min/max ranges
- **Fragmentation**: Large enemies break into smaller enemies when destroyed
- **Scoring**: Each enemy kill awards points based on the number of vertices

### Weapon Systems

#### Standard Bullets
- Fire towards mouse cursor position
- Limited lifespan (auto-despawn after configurable frames)
- Kill enemies on collision

#### Special Weapon
- Radial blast centered on the player
- Fires bullets in all directions (360° coverage)
- Limited usage based on player configuration

### Physics & Movement

- **Custom Vector Math**: Dedicated `vec2` class for position, velocity, and direction calculations
- **Collision Detection**: Circle-based bounding volumes for all shapes
- **Boundary Constraints**: Player is confined to window boundaries

### Configuration System

All gameplay parameters are loaded from `assets/config.txt`:

- Window dimensions and framerate
- Player attributes (size, speed, fire rate, colors)
- Enemy properties (spawn rate, speed range, vertex count)
- Bullet characteristics (speed, lifespan, size)
- Font and UI settings

**Example config.txt:**
```
Window 1200 720 60 0
Font Assets/KillerTech.ttf 24 255 255 255
Player 32 32 5 5 5 5 255 0 0 4 8 90
Enemy 32 32 3 5 255 255 255 2 3 8 90 90 100 200
Bullet 10 10 8 255 255 255 255 255 255 2 20 90
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize the game by editing `assets/config.txt`. Here's what each parameter means:

### Window Configuration
```
Window <width> <height> <framerate> <fullscreen>
```

### Player Configuration
```
Player <shapeRadius> <collisionRadius> <speed> <fillR> <fillG> <fillB> <outlineR> <outlineG> <outlineB> <outlineThickness> <vertices> <specialWeaponCooldown>
```

### Enemy Configuration
```
Enemy <shapeRadius> <collisionRadius> <speedMin> <speedMax> <outlineR> <outlineG> <outlineB> <outlineThickness> <minVertices> <maxVertices> <smallLifespan> <spawnInterval> <scoreMultiplier> <smallEnemyScore>
```

### Bullet Configuration
```
Bullet <shapeRadius> <collisionRadius> <speed> <fillR> <fillG> <fillB> <outlineR> <outlineG> <outlineB> <outlineThickness> <vertices> <lifespan>
```
